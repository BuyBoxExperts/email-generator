# Email Generator

Generate a random email address from the terminal.

Buy Box Experts has hundreds to thousands of Amazon clients and needs a way to create email aliases for each of them. This allows Buy Box Experts to receive permissions from each client to this email alias without the need to conform to wonky naming schemes or spend time building email aliases.

## Usage

```bash
# Create a random email
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buyboxexperts/email-generator/master/generate-email.sh)
# Output example => amazon+64e28e088ad6d6d5@buyboxexperts.com
```
