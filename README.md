# Email Generator

Generate a random email address from the terminal.

Buy Box Experts has hundreds to thousands of Amazon clients and therefore needs a way to create email aliases for each of them. This allows us to receive permissions from each client to this emailed alias without the need to conform to wonky naming schemes.

## Usage

```bash
# Create a random email
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buyboxexperts/email-generator/master/generate-email.sh)
```
